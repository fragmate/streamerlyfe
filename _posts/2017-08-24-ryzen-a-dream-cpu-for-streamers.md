I may be late to the party in shouting to the cosmos the greatness of AMD's latest processor line-up but indeed, it is excellent *and* an answer to the streamer who may be struggling with something like an overclocked _Intel i5-2500K_ at 4.5GHz that is struggling to push 120+ frames per second at 1080p in a game such as *Overwatch*
 while in tandem broadcasting to the world.

For those that require photographic evidence that I am not endorsing this product at gun-point and proudly have one firing away in in my box:
![Proof of owning Ryzen]({{ base.url }}/assets/evidence/ryzen.png)

## Performance

Prior to the god-send Ryzen, I was sitting on a four-year old [Intel i5-2500k](https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i5-2500K-Quad-Core-Processor-Cache/dp/B004EBUXHQ/?tag=treameyfe-20){:rel="nofollow" target="_blank"} processor. It was a champ but could not meet the level of intruction required to give my viewers a good broadcast *and* uphold a competitive in-game experience at 144 frames per second at 1080p. Being a captain of an _Overwatch_ grandmaster-level team at the time, it was a deal-breaker.

The [Ryzen 7 1700](https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Processor-Wraith-Cooler-YD1700BBAEBOX/dp/B06WP5YCX6/?tag=treameyfe-20){:rel="nofollow" target="_blank"} coming in at eight cores (3.7GHz per core) simply answers a lot of the typical performance frustrations of the streamer with sheer volume. I could throw benchmarks at you but the simple fact is, I throw my game on four of the eight cores and [OBS](https://obsproject.com/){:rel="nofollow" target="_blank"} on the other four-- the 7 1700 doesn't break a sweat over it. This is of course with the caveat that you are encoding via CPU within OBS or whatever streaming software you're using. If you're presently using your GPU for encoding, you may see no improvement at all.

_Overwatch_ is an _incredibly_ CPU-intensive game so I can confidently state that it is _doubtful_ that you won't see performance improvements in whatever game you might be presently streaming. And certainly if you are not pushing for a 144 FPS/1080p experience in-game, the 7 1700 will be **more than enough**.

**Disclaimer**: I presently have a *slight* overclock (3.85 GHz) on my [Ryzen 7 1700](https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Processor-Wraith-Cooler-YD1700BBAEBOX/dp/B06WP5YCX6/?tag=treameyfe-20){:rel="nofollow" target="_blank"}, which is honestly quite negligable-- it was more of a nerdgasm between my friend & me as opposed to a bottleneck requiring the adjustment in performance. Also, I am *not* using the stock cooler shipped with the chip but instead the *incredibly* cheap [Cool Master Hyper 212 Evo (~$30)](https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-Hyper-RR-212E-20PK-R2-120mm/dp/B005O65JXI/?tag=treameyfe-20){:rel="nofollow" target="_blank"}.

## Bias

Considering I've been an owner of both Intel and AMD products, I'd like to think that removes me from any kind of bias toward either company. The Ryzen processor line-up just comes in at a lower price (starting ~$180) than its Intel counterparts (the i5 and i7s) at no real cost in performance.

Regarding my selection of the [Ryzen 7 1700](https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Processor-Wraith-Cooler-YD1700BBAEBOX/dp/B06WP5YCX6/?tag=treameyfe-20){:rel="nofollow" target="_blank"} over the other processors within the Ryzen family, I firmly believe that _at minimum_ a [Ryzen 5 1600](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XNRQHG4/?tag=treameyfe-20){:rel="nofollow" target="_blank"} is required to find a painless streaming experience. Although I can't say with certainty that it can meet the levels of performance needed for 144 FPS/1080p in-game in addition to streaming-- however, my teammate picked one up and seemed to have little issue in getting the performance he wanted, granted his GPU, RAM, among other things might be big contributors.

## Price

The [Ryzen 7 1700](https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Processor-Wraith-Cooler-YD1700BBAEBOX/dp/B06WP5YCX6/?tag=treameyfe-20){:rel="nofollow" target="_blank"} comes in at $300 which is $30 dollars less than its Intel counterpart, the [Intel i7-7700K](https://www.amazon.com/Intel-Desktop-Processor-i7-7700K-BX80677I77700K/dp/B01MXSI216/?tag=treameyfe-20){:rel="nofollow" target="_blank"}. Now I hate to introduce another caveat but the Ryzen processors require the new _AM4_ socket, which will likely require you to pick up a new motherboard. I am presently using the [MSI B350 Tomahawk (~$100)](https://www.amazon.com/MSI-Gaming-B350-Motherboard-TOMAHAWK/dp/B06WVFFXXL/?tag=treameyfe-20){:rel="nofollow" target="_blank"} and have faced _zero_ problems the past couple months.

Now, yes, you might be thinking that it's insensible to throw another $70 over the price-point of the i7-7700K which would suit you just fine. Well it probably would but remember, you're buying into the Ryzen platform-- one that meets (if not exceeds) Intel's line-up. AMD has no intentions to stop making processors. Take a look at AMD's [Ryzen Threadripper](https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Threadripper-32-thread-Processor-YD195XA8AEWOF/dp/B074CBH3R4/?tag=treameyfe-20){:rel="nofollow" target="_blank"} which released quite recently. They're obviously looking to bring the fight to Intel on both price _and_ performance.

**So in summary**: you're making a decision that could benefit you on your next upgrade cycle after having made this one.
